# Directory Listing

The objective of the lab was to disable directory listing on your Apache web server.

## Extra Lab #1: Web Servers w/ Directory Listing Enabled
In this lab, we will examine why directory listing should be disabled. The lab requires Internet connected devices.

1. Open your web browser then visit [https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/).

2. Search for `"index of /"`, including double quotes (`"`). Or simply click [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22index+of+%2F%22](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22index+of+%2F%22).

3. You would be able to find many web servers with directory listing enabled. Some files on those servers may have sensitive information.
